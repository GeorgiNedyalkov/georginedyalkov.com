          </p>
          <p>
            For the past year I have been learning how to code the basics of web
            development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, now I am focussing on
            learning React and backend development with NodeJS and MondoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am following the web developer in

          <p>
            I have been working on projects that solve problems from my previous
            working experience as a digital marketer in the real estate
            development industry. You can check out my

          <h2>Front-End</h2>
          <p>
            After learning the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I started
            learning React UI. To create a website however I had to learn about
            design and user experience, which is why I also learned how to use
            Figma and Excalidraw to create wireframes and mockups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the majority of a front-end developer job is creating a web
            app from a given design, every day I do little projects, separated
            from my personal projects, which help me learn how to create common
            features.
          </p>

        <div id="back-end">
          <img className="about_image" src={BackEnd} alt="back end image" />
          <h2>Back-End</h2>
          <p>
            Because of my desire to create full working project by myself I had
            to learn how to write back-end software. I started with node and
            express and learned how to build basic APIs. In the Back-End course
            in SoftUni I learned many more concepts and deepened my knowledge. I
            learned about concepts like: authorization, encryption,
            models-controller-service framework, middlewares, buffers, http
            protocol and how the internet works in general. I always like to
            cement my knowledge by writing an article for the things I study.

          <h2>What's the story?</h2>
          <p>
            For the past 7 years I have been working in a real estate
            development company called Atlantis Bulgaria Holding. First I
            started as an agent and then I got promoted to a marketing manager
            and lead a team of both content creators and sales agents. Though my
            work compensated me well something was missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found programming and that ignited a spark I have never felt for
            something I enjoy doing as a profession. For the past year I have
            been learning how to code by myself first and then with SoftUni so
            that I can calibrate what I know with best practices. I have one
            more semester to complete the JavaScript developer path.
