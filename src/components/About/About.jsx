      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring web developer with skills in JavaScript, React and Node
        JS.

        Hi, I'm Georgi. For the past 6 years I have been working in the real
        estate industry as a sales agent and later marketing manager. But at the
        same time I started learning how to code because I wanted to be able to
        create things by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past year I have been studying programming and developing simple
        applications to learn how to code. I started with html, css and
        javascript. Later I continued to learn React and now I am still figuring
        out Redux.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also taken a course on back-end development with node and build
        express applications. I learned about concepts like authorization,
        encryption, databases, CRUD operations, MVC framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been taking courses in SoftUni that guided my own self-stuying
        method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first application that I wanted to create was to solve a problem for
        my own work.
      </p>
