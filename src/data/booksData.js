    cover: war_of_art,
    description: `Since 2002, The War of Art has inspired people around the world to defeat "Resistance"; 
    to recognize and knock down dream-blocking barriers and to silence the naysayers within us.Resistance kicks everyone's butt, 
    and the desire to defeat it is equally as universal. The War of Art identifies the enemy that every one of us must face, 
    outlines a battle plan to conquer this internal foe, then pinpoints just how to achieve the greatest success.Though it was written for writers, 
    it has been embraced by business entrepreneurs, actors, dancers, painters, photographers, filmmakers, military service members and thousands of others around the world.`,

    description: `After Englishman John Blackthorne is lost at sea, he awakens in a place few Europeans know of and even fewer have seen—Nippon. 
    Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, 
    Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. 
    As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne’s loyalty and strength of 
    character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.`,
